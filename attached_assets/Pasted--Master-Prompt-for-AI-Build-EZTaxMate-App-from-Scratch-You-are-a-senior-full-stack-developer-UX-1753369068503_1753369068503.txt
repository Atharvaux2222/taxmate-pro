✅ Master Prompt for AI (Build EZTaxMate App from Scratch)
You are a senior full-stack developer, UX designer, and product manager all in one. I want you to help me build a real-world web app for Indian users called **EZTaxMate**.

### 🎯 App Goal:
Build a web application that simplifies income tax return (ITR-1) filing for newly joined employees in India (0–3 years experience), using AI. The app should:
- Automatically extract data from Form 16 (PDF/image)
- Explain tax terms in beginner-friendly language
- Offer AI-based tax-saving suggestions (under sections like 80C, 80D)
- Allow users to download a completed ITR-1 JSON file
- Provide an optional GPT-powered chatbot (TaxBot) for queries

---

### 🧑‍💼 Target Audience:
- Young working professionals (fresher to 3 years)
- Salary varies from ₹3–20 LPA
- Low to medium financial literacy
- Wants ease, guidance, and financial growth

---

### 🔁 Core Workflow:
1. ✅ Google Login
2. ❓ Friendly Q&A to understand user goals
3. 📂 Upload Form 16 (PDF/image) with clear help
4. 🤖 OCR + GPT AI extracts salary, TDS, deductions
5. 👶 Walkthrough of extracted data, with "Explain like I'm 5" option
6. 🧠 AI suggests personalized investment tips (e.g., ELSS, health insurance)
7. 📝 Auto-fill ITR-1 and allow user to download JSON
8. 💬 Optional AI Chatbot for user questions (TaxBot)
9. 🏠 Dashboard with progress bar and helpful nudges

### 🎨 Design Style:
- Clean, emoji-friendly UI
- Progress bar showing steps
- Easy / Advanced mode toggle
- Accessible language with tooltips
- Mobile-responsive

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (Preferred):
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (or Next.js)
- Backend: Node.js + Express OR Flask (Python)
- OCR: Tesseract.js / PyTesseract
- AI: GPT-4 API or GPT-4o for extraction + chatbot
- Auth: Firebase Authentication (Google OAuth)
- Database: Firebase Firestore or MongoDB
- File Handling: Firebase Storage or Cloudinary
- Deployment: Vercel / Netlify / Render

### 📥 AI Features to Implement:
1. **Prompt GPT to extract structured JSON from messy OCR text of Form 16** (fields: Name, PAN, Employer, Gross Salary, Deductions under 80C, 80D, TDS Paid, Tax Payable).
2. **Prompt GPT to suggest savings** based on missing deductions and age group (e.g., ELSS for 80C, health insurance for 80D).
3. **Create a friendly chatbot** that answers ITR-related questions with a tone that's helpful, non-technical, and accurate.

### 🔮 Future Enhancements:
- ITR-U support (updated returns)
- AIS/26AS comparison with Form 16
- Track investments made by user
- Year-round tax planning
- Multilingual support (Hindi, Tamil, etc.)

### ✅ Task for You:
Build this entire app from scratch — end-to-end.
1. Start by scaffolding the folder structure.
2. Implement frontend UI with step-by-step experience.
3. Create backend routes for Form 16 parsing and AI interaction.
4. Include sample prompts and dummy data.
5. Explain how to deploy it live and test it.
6. Document the architecture and reasoning.

This project should be understandable for a developer who wants to customize and expand it later. Add comments, explanations, and make it clean and maintainable.

Now generate the full app, starting from structure, then go component by component.
